### Features:

- **🔐safe:** all the code runs in a sandboxed Web Assembly environment
- **🕵️private:** no data or code sent to any servers
- **🏎fast:** near-native speed with no network communication needed (and automatic GPU offloading through WebGL)
- **🏗scalable:** execution happens on the client so it doesn't matter how many people you share it with!
- **📵works offline:** it. just does. well as long as your web browser is on your local machine...

## Quickstart

## Goals

- Power explainers that use simulations or other data analyses that are awkward to accomplish in Javacript (or that you don't want to do in JS).
- Make web based interactive documents accessible to the scientific python/data science community.
- Enable expensive computational operations that would otherwise be infeasible in interactive experiences.

## Roadmap

TBD
